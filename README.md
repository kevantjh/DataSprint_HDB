# Scenario
You are a data analyst at WOW!, a leading real estate agency in Singapore. The HDB
resale market has become increasingly competitive, with a rise in demand and volatile
pricing trends. The agency wants to empower their agents with a data-driven tool to:
  - Offer competitive pricing advice for clients looking to buy or sell HDB resale flats.
  - Accurately estimate HDB resale flat values for different flat types and locations.
Your manager informs you that a team of data analysts is being formed to analyse the
HDB resale market in Singapore and build a predictive model in a short turnaround.

# Objectives
  - Leverage HDB resale price data to identify the top factors and how they influence
  - HDB resale prices for WOW!: What are the key factors that the agents of WOW!
  - should focus on delivering accurate pricing advice?
  - Utilise the data analytics workflow within an agile development framework.
  - Transform data into useful information to help support business decisions.
  - Gain experience with project management and associated tools.

# Structure of the Sprint
The data sprint will be a three-day ‘sprint simulation’: A hypothetical scenario
which is based on a real-world HDB resale price market.
  - You will be put into groups and will work in those breakout groups throughout the
day.
  - You will run a three-day sprint, and then wrap up the sprint at the end of day three
and present your findings and what you have learned from the process in the
morning of day four.
  - Instructors will be playing the role of product owner and scrum master, and will
help prioritise your work and coach you. The product owner has already created
an initial product backlog.
  - You need to agree on the sprint backlog (high-level milestones) to complete with
your group each day; you will also need to agree on a strategy for the day and a
plan to divide up the work amongst you.
  - You will conduct a sprint review with your product owner at the end of sprint one,
two and three to show them what you have completed from the sprint backlog.
  - We ask that you approach these three days with a creative analytical mindset!
